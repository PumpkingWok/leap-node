# Custom tendermint in leap-node

We want to make sure there is no not-submitted periods older than 64 blocks ago. For this we added a custom `CheckBridge` ABCI to
Tendermint [1]. Yes, we are using forked Tendermint and, yes, this is disgusting.

Consider the following data:
```

blocks:  0 ..... 31 | 32 .... 63 | 64 ... 95 | 96 ... 127
periods: p1           p2           p3          p4
                                                   â†‘
                                                   we are here at block 99
```

if after block 96 the period `p2` is not yet on the root chain, `CheckBridge` will stop consensus till `p2` is on the root chain [2].
Incoming transactions will keep piling in mempool and will be processed to the block once consensus resume.
